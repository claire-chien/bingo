# Bingo!

#### This is an interactive two-player Bingo game. 
The rules are simple: Each player inputs 24 numbers (no repeats, must be between 1-40) to construct their board. The game draws two boards based the user input, with a free square in the center.

The program will draw a new number each round and check the boards for any hits, filling the square with an "x" if it matches the number for the round.
